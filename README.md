# Before You Begin

# Data Modeling 
  After loading in the CSV files, you should inspects the contents of each one. AFter inspecting the CSV files, sketch out and Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.

# Data Engineering
  After the Entity Relationship Diagrams are complete, use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
  While creating the table schemas make sure to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other contraints.
  After ach table is created, import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
